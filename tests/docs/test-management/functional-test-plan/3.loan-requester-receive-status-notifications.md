### Test Plan for User Story: Approvals Notifications | SMS

**Objective**: To ensure that loan requesters receive timely and accurate SMS notifications regarding the status of their loan requests, including approval and rejection notifications.

#### Scope
- Verify SMS notifications for both approval and rejection scenarios.
- Ensure that notifications are sent correctly and contain the appropriate information.
- Confirm that relationship managers are notified in case of rejections for further communication.

#### Test Environment
- Mobile devices with various carriers.
- Test data: Loan requests in different stages of approval/rejection.
- Notification services and configurations.

#### Assumptions
- The SMS notification service is integrated and functional.
- The relationship manager and loan requesters have valid contact information.

### Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

**Risk Analysis**:
1. **High Risk**:
   - SMS notifications not being sent or received.
   - Incorrect or incomplete information in the SMS notifications.
2. **Medium Risk**:
   - Delayed SMS notifications.
   - Failure to notify the relationship manager in case of rejections.
3. **Low Risk**:
   - Minor formatting issues in the SMS content.
   - Localization issues for SMS messages.

### Test Cases

#### Acceptance Test Cases

1. **Verify approval SMS notification**:
   - **Given**: All relevant departments and the relationship manager have approved a loan request.
   - **When**: The system processes the final approval.
   - **Then**: The loan requester should receive an SMS indicating the approval status.

2. **Verify rejection notification to relationship manager**:
   - **Given**: A loan request has been rejected at any stage of the approvals process with specified reasons.
   - **When**: The system processes the rejection at any step during departments approvals stage.
   - **Then**: The relationship manager responsible for this request should be notified to communicate the reasons with the loan requester and solve the issues.

3. **Verify final rejection SMS notification to loan requester**:
   - **Given**: The relationship manager rejects the loan request (Final Rejection).
   - **When**: The system processes the final rejection.
   - **Then**: The loan requester should receive an SMS indicating the rejection with the specified reasons provided by the relationship manager only.

#### Edge Test Cases

1. **Verify SMS notification with invalid phone number**:
   - **Given**: The loan requester has an invalid phone number.
   - **When**: The system attempts to send an SMS notification.
   - **Then**: The system should log an error and not attempt to send the SMS repeatedly
   - **And**: The relationship manager should be notified to follow up with loan requester to provide a valid phone number.

2. **Verify SMS notification during network outage**:
   - **Given**: There is a network outage affecting the SMS gateway.
   - **When**: The system attempts to send an SMS notification.
   - **Then**: The system should retry sending the SMS after a certain interval and log the error.

3. **Verify multiple rejections at different stages**:
   - **Given**: A loan request is rejected at multiple stages with different reasons.
   - **When**: The system processes each rejection.
   - **Then**: The relationship manager should be notified after each rejection, and the final rejection should send an SMS to the loan requester with the last specified reason.

4. **Verify SMS content formatting**:
   - **Given**: The system sends an SMS notification.
   - **When**: The SMS is received.
   - **Then**: The content of the SMS should be correctly formatted and readable on various devices.

### Test Runs

**Initial Test Run**:
- Test the basic flow of sending SMS notifications for both approval and rejection scenarios.
- Verify that the notifications are sent and received with the correct content.
- Conduct this test on various mobile devices and carriers.

**Regression Test Run**:
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new updates do not affect the existing functionality.
- Focus on the integration between the loan approval system and the SMS notification service.

**Performance Test Run**:
- Test the performance of the SMS notification service.
- Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent notifications without delays.

**Edge Case Test Run**:
- Test all edge cases to ensure the system handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
