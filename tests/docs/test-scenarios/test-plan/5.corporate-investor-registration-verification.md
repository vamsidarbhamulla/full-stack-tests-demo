### Test Plan for User Story: Corporate Investor - Commercial Registration Verification Via Third Party Service

**Objective**: To ensure that the system accurately verifies commercial registration numbers for corporate investors using third-party service and handles both valid and invalid data appropriately.

#### Scope
- Verify the integration with third-party service for commercial registration verification.
- Ensure the system correctly handles valid and invalid commercial registration numbers.
- Validate the company's start date based on the information retrieved from third-party service.

#### Test Environment
- Web and mobile platforms.
- Various browsers and operating systems.
- Test data: Commercial registration numbers (both valid and invalid), corporate investor details.

#### Assumptions
- The system is successfully integrated with third-party service.
- The commercial registration numbers provided are accurate and up-to-date.

### Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

**Risk Analysis**:
1. **High Risk**:
   - Failure to send or receive data from the third-party service.
   - Incorrect handling of valid and invalid commercial registration numbers.
2. **Medium Risk**:
   - Delays in receiving responses from the third-party service.
   - Incorrect validation of the company's start date.
3. **Low Risk**:
   - Minor UI/UX issues in the registration verification process.
   - Localization issues (multi-language support).

### Test Cases

#### Acceptance Test Cases

1. **Verify successful sending of commercial registration number to third party service**:
   - **Given**: The system is integrated to access the third-party service.
   - **And**: The user has finished their commercial registration successfully.
   - **Then**: The system should send the commercial registration number to third-party service.

2. **Verify handling of valid commercial registration number**:
   - **Given**: A user wants to verify a commercial registration number.
   - **When**: The system gets a result from the third-party service that the number is valid.
   - **Then**: The user should be able to proceed to the validation process.

3. **Verify handling of invalid commercial registration number**:
   - **Given**: A user has entered an invalid commercial registration number.
   - **When**: The system gets a result from the third-party service that the number is invalid.
   - **Then**: The system should ask the user to enter a valid number.
   - **And**: After entering a new number, the system should restart the verification process with third-party service.

4. **Verify validation of company start date**:
   - **Given**: The verification process via third-party service is successfully done.
   - **When**: The system gets the result from third-party service.
   - **Then**: The system should validate the company's start date.
   - **If**: The start date is less than two years.
   - **Then**: The system should notify the user that they cannot proceed.
   - **If**: The start date is more than two years.
   - **Then**: The system should allow the user to proceed to the next step.

#### Edge Test Cases

1. **Verify handling of network outages**:
   - **Given**: There is a network outage between the system and the third-party service.
   - **When**: The system tries to send or receive data.
   - **Then**: The system should log an error and retry after a certain interval.

2. **Verify handling of special characters in commercial registration numbers**:
   - **Given**: A user enters a commercial registration number with special characters.
   - **When**: The system sends the number to the third-party service.
   - **Then**: The system should handle the special characters correctly and validate the input.

3. **Verify handling of multiple invalid attempts**:
   - **Given**: A user repeatedly enters invalid commercial registration numbers.
   - **When**: The system receives invalid responses from the third-party service.
   - **Then**: The system should limit the number of attempts and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

4. **Verify handling of large data volumes**:
   - **Given**: The system processes a large number of commercial registration verifications simultaneously.
   - **When**: The system sends and receives data from the third-party service.
   - **Then**: The system should handle the data volume without performance degradation.

### Test Runs

**Initial Test Run**:
- Test the basic flow of sending commercial registration numbers to third-party service and handling valid and invalid responses.
- Verify that the company's start date is validated correctly.
- Conduct this test on various browsers and devices.

**Regression Test Run**:
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new updates do not affect the existing functionality.
- Focus on the integration with third-party service and the validation processes.

**Performance Test Run**:
- Test the performance of the system when processing multiple commercial registration verifications.
- Ensure the system can handle large data volumes without degradation.

**Edge Case Test Run**:
- Test all edge cases to ensure the system handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
- Verify proper error handling and user feedback.
