### Test Plan for User Story: Departments Approval

**Objective**: To ensure that department staff members can review and approve loan requests, and that the system accurately displays approval statuses from multiple departments.

#### Scope
- Verify the functionality of approving loan requests by department staff members.
- Ensure the system correctly displays the approval details, including departments, staff members, and timestamps.

#### Test Environment
- Web and mobile platforms.
- Various browsers and operating systems.
- Test data: Loan requests in different stages of approval, multiple departments.

#### Assumptions
- The department staff members are authenticated and authorized to approve loan requests.
- The system has accurate and up-to-date information on department staff members and loan requests.

### Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

**Risk Analysis**:
1. **High Risk**:
   - Approval actions not being recorded correctly.
   - Inaccurate or incomplete display of approval details.
2. **Medium Risk**:
   - UI/UX issues in the approval workflow.
   - Performance issues during the approval process.
3. **Low Risk**:
   - Minor validation errors.
   - Localization issues (multi-language support).

### Test Cases

#### Acceptance Test Cases

1. **Verify the "Approve" button visibility**:
   - **Given**: A loan request is currently in review by a specific department.
   - **When**: The department representative reviews the request.
   - **Then**: They should see an "Approve" button.

2. **Verify approval action**:
   - **Given**: A loan request is currently in review by a specific department.
   - **When**: The representative clicks "Approve".
   - **Then**: The request should be marked as approved from their department.

3. **Verify multiple department approvals display**:
   - **Given**: A loan request has been approved by multiple departments.
   - **When**: The system user views the details of the request.
   - **Then**: They should see a section displaying all departments that have approved the request, with the staff members who gave the approval and the timestamp of each approval.

#### Edge Test Cases

1. **Verify approval button for unauthorized users**:
   - **Given**: An unauthorized user accesses a loan request in review.
   - **When**: They attempt to review the request.
   - **Then**: They should not see the "Approve" button.

2. **Verify handling of simultaneous approvals**:
   - **Given**: Multiple department representatives attempt to approve the same loan request simultaneously.
   - **When**: They click "Approve".
   - **Then**: The system should handle the concurrency gracefully and correctly record all approvals.

3. **Verify approval with missing data**:
   - **Given**: A loan request in review is missing some required data.
   - **When**: The department representative reviews the request.
   - **Then**: They should see an error message indicating the missing data.

4. **Verify approval details with special characters**:
   - **Given**: A loan request is approved by departments with special characters in their names.
   - **When**: The system user views the details of the request.
   - **Then**: The display should correctly render the special characters.

### Test Runs

**Initial Test Run**:
- Test the basic flow of approving loan requests by department representatives.
- Verify that approval actions are recorded correctly and the approval details are displayed accurately.
- Conduct this test on various browsers and devices.

**Regression Test Run**:
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new updates do not affect the existing functionality.
- Focus on the approval workflow and display of approval details.

**Performance Test Run**:
- Test the performance of the approval process.
- Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent approvals without degradation.

**Edge Case Test Run**:
- Test all edge cases to ensure the system handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
- Verify proper error handling and user feedback.
