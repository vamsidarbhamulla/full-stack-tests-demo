### Test Plan for "Registered User Login From a New Device"

#### Objective:
To ensure that registered users can successfully log in from a new device, receive a successful login notification, and be logged out from all other devices.

#### Scope:
- Functional Testing
- Usability Testing
- Security Testing
- Performance Testing

#### Test Environment:
- Devices: Desktop, Mobile, Tablet
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- OS: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android

#### Assumptions
- The user has valid credentials to log in.
- The user has multiple devices to validate only single session is active.


### Risk Based Testing (RBT)

#### High-Risk Areas:
- Login Functionality
- OTP Verification
- Logout from Other Devices
- SMS Notification

#### Medium-Risk Areas:
- Input Validation
- Error Handling
- Redirection to Home Page

#### Low-Risk Areas:
- UI Elements
- Text and Messages

### Possible Test Cases

#### Acceptance Test Cases:
1. **Login with Correct Credentials**
   - Given the user is on the login page
   - When they enter valid phone number and password
   - Then they should be able to click the next button, enter the OTP, and log in successfully
   - And they should receive a successful login message and be redirected to the home page

2. **Successful OTP Verification**
   - Given the user has entered valid credentials
   - When they are prompted to enter the OTP
   - And they enter the correct OTP
   - Then they should be logged in successfully

3. **SMS Notification on New Device Login**
   - Given the user logs in from a new device
   - When the login is successful
   - Then an SMS notification should be sent to the user

4. **Logout from All Other Devices**
   - Given the user logs in from a new device
   - When the login is successful
   - Then the user should be logged out from all other devices

#### Edge Test Cases:
1. **Login with Incorrect Password**
   - Given the user is on the login page
   - When they enter a valid phone number but an incorrect password
   - Then they should see an error message and not be able to proceed

2. **OTP Expired**
   - Given the user is prompted to enter the OTP
   - When the OTP has expired
   - Then they should receive an error message and a prompt to request a new OTP

3. **Invalid Phone Number Format**
   - Given the user is on the login page
   - When they enter an invalid phone number format
   - Then they should receive an error message

4. **Network Failure During Login**
   - Given the user is in the process of logging in
   - When there is a network failure
   - Then they should receive a network error message

### Test Runs
1. **Initial Functional Testing**
   - Execute all acceptance and edge test cases
   - Identify and log defects

2. **Regression Testing**
   - After defects are fixed, re-run relevant test cases
   - Ensure no new issues are introduced

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Simulate multiple users logging in simultaneously
   - Ensure the system handles load efficiently

4. **Usability Testing**
   - Ensure the login process is intuitive and user-friendly

5. **Security Testing**
   - Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF
   - Ensure data security and privacy
