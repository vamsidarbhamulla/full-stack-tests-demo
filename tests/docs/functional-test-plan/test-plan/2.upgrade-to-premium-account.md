### Test Plan for User Story: Individual Investor - Upgrade To Premium

**Objective**: To ensure that the functionality for upgrading a regular account to a premium account for verified individual users works as expected, including the selection of eligibility criteria, document upload, and notification mechanisms.

#### Scope
- Verify the upgrade process from a regular to a premium account.
- Ensure users can select at least one eligibility criterion.
- Validate document upload functionality.
- Confirm notifications are sent to both the compliance team and the relation manager.
- Ensure users receive a notification after successful document upload.

#### Test Environment
- Web and mobile platforms.
- Various browsers and operating systems.
- Test data: Verified individual user accounts, sample documents.

#### Assumptions
- The user is already logged in and verified.
- The compliance department and relation managers have access to the relevant dashboards.

### Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

**Risk Analysis**:
1. **High Risk**:
   - Failure in the document upload process.
   - Notifications not being sent to the compliance team or relation manager.
   - Incorrect handling of user information and eligibility criteria.
2. **Medium Risk**:
   - UI/UX issues in the upgrade process.
   - Performance issues during document upload.
3. **Low Risk**:
   - Minor validation errors.
   - Localization issues (multi-language support).

### Test Cases

#### Acceptance Test Cases

1. **Verify upgrade button functionality**:
   - Given a verified individual user,
   - When the user clicks the "upgrade to premium" button,
   - Then the user should see the eligibility criteria selection page.

2. **Verify eligibility criteria selection**:
   - Given a user on the eligibility criteria selection page,
   - When the user selects one option,
   - Then the user should be able to proceed to the document upload page.

3. **Verify document upload functionality**:
   - Given a user on the document upload page,
   - When the user uploads the required documents,
   - Then the documents should be uploaded successfully.

4. **Verify compliance team notification**:
   - Given the documents are uploaded successfully,
   - When the compliance team views the upgrade request,
   - Then they should be able to approve the request.

5. **Verify relation manager notification**:
   - Given the compliance team approves the request,
   - When the relation manager is notified,
   - Then they should receive a notification about the request status.

6. **Verify user notification on successful upload**:
   - Given the user uploads the documents successfully,
   - When the upload is complete,
   - Then the user should receive a notification confirming the upload.

#### Edge Test Cases

1. **Verify document upload with invalid formats**:
   - Given a user on the document upload page,
   - When the user uploads documents in invalid formats,
   - Then an error message should be displayed.

2. **Verify multiple eligibility criteria selection**:
   - Given a user on the eligibility criteria selection page,
   - When the user selects multiple options,
   - Then the system should handle it gracefully or restrict to one selection.

3. **Verify long document names**:
   - Given a user on the document upload page,
   - When the user uploads documents with long filenames,
   - Then the system should handle the filenames appropriately.

4. **Verify session timeout during document upload**:
   - Given a user on the document upload page,
   - When the session times out during the upload,
   - Then the user should be prompted to log in again and resume the upload.

### Test Runs

**Initial Test Run**:
- Test the basic flow of upgrading to a premium account.
- Verify that the eligibility criteria, document upload, and notifications work as expected.
- Conduct this test on various browsers and devices.

**Regression Test Run**:
- Perform regression testing to ensure that new updates do not affect the existing functionality.
- Focus on document upload and notification systems.

**Performance Test Run**:
- Test the performance of the document upload process.
- Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent uploads without degradation.

**Edge Case Test Run**:
- Test all edge cases to ensure the system handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
- Verify proper error handling and user feedback.
