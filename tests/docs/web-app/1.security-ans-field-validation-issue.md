**Title**: Security Answer Field Accepts Non-Date Input for Date Security Question in User Registration Form

**Description**: The user registration form allows any text to be entered in the security answer field, even when the security question is specifically asking for a date. This could lead to inconsistent and potentially insecure user data.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to the user registration form on the application.
2. Select a security question dropdown option that asks for "Mother's birth date" or "Father's birth date"
3. Enter any non-date text (e.g., "abc123") in the security answer field.
4. Submit the registration form.

**Expected Result**: The form should validate the input and only accept date formats (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY") for security questions that require a date.

**Actual Result**: The form accepts any text input in the security answer field, regardless of the security question type.
